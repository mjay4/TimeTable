# TimeTable

This project is simple representation of how we can effectively create timetable allocation website.
The initial UI and simple funcitons that were important for the repsentation are implemented.
The idea here is to provide all the details of the faculty and the available classes on single page. Hence reducing the time and effort in allocating classes for each professor. 

## The main file is named as "checkit.html".
